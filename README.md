# passphrase
A simple bash script that generates random dictionary-derived passwords for me. It takes three arguments:

* **-c** <*number*>

  Provides *n* groups of passwords.

* **-s**

  Include spaces between all words.

* **-w** <*number*>

  Provides phrases containing *n* number of words.

Here's an example. Feel free to mix and match and use these as passwords. They would be good passwords. I'm not using any of them. I swear.

```shell
$ passphrase -c 5 -s

arrival peeving fazes
privies ending engulfed
rumpled stately uncanny
chancel simper crazily
shush bedroll deputing

warmer shockers warded
grimly grafts mothball
vortex hooks mastery
gym stilts dogtrot
padlocks greeted nameless

ivories centered cambiums
plugins racks shuttle
carotids neatness hansom
duress heeled cuddles
shrike hanky policy

nowhere teammate confuse
wooziest commence lattice
cottoned whit outlasts
peptic carom knifed
tights mistake grumble

quells kissed amazons
mood prowl sold
viler cookies rehabs
hollows cursed lived
rove travails visaed
