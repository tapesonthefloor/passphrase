# passphrase
A simple bash script that generates random dictionary-derived passwords for me.

Here's an example. Feel free to mix and match and use these as passwords. They would be good passwords. I'm not using any of them. I swear.

`tree eardrum format
`yachts guerilla sheepdog
`duos sites coats
`downier qualms whim
`tanked lissome others
`
`handsome scissor shin
`fees sicked mender
`tabs adders malaise
`nonfat surfer smoothed
`urn drams copied
`
`tossup waters stomachs
`cup clings shacks
`syrups crouch dynamo
`thwacked exempt kudzu
`parvenu augments cushion
`
`thievery conjugal layer
`cantos castoffs ham
`showmen pacified wheres
`sorriest garrotte howdah
`yap credos boringly
`
