# passphrase
A simple bash script that generates random dictionary-derived passwords for me. It takes three arguments:

**-c** <*number*>

  Provides *n* groups of passwords.

**-s**

  Include spaces between all words.

**-w** <*number*>

  Provides phrases of *n* words.

Here's an example. Feel free to mix and match and use these as passwords. They would be good passwords. I'm not using any of them. I swear.

```shell
$ passphrase -c 5 -s

tree eardrum format
yachts guerilla sheepdog
duos sites coats
downier qualms whim
tanked lissome others

handsome scissor shin
fees sicked mender
tabs adders malaise
nonfat surfer smoothed
urn drams copied

tossup waters stomachs
cup clings shacks
syrups crouch dynamo
thwacked exempt kudzu
parvenu augments cushion

thievery conjugal layer
cantos castoffs ham
showmen pacified wheres
sorriest garrotte howdah
yap credos boringly

medicate repaying self
nudge seekers garnets
lacquers stunted puller
aback unseats lifespan
slab against ape
```
